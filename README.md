Hello my name is Erick Pascual and I am an aspiring software engineer. I have dabbled in web development however I am slowly coming to the realization that I do not like web
design. What I mean by this is that I dont really like dealing with the frontend. I do not know if this is because I find the frontend hard and consider myself not creative.
Regradless some things that I would love to mess around in goes as such
- game development (unity, unreal)
- backend work
- server work
- cybersecurity
- machine learning

Thank you for reading my thoughts.
